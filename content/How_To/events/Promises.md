# How To Use Promises

## Introduction

Starting with v3.2, we introduced (without breaking backward compatibility of course) a new pattern: the promises.

In a nutshell, the basic idea is to rely on promises instead of having to deal with pyramids of callbacks intricated in a non easy to maintain way.
Regarding portability, Babylon.js provides a custom polyfill for browsers where promises are not supported so you can blindly use them.
