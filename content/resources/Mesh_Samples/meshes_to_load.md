# Available Meshes for Importing

Depending on the scale of the mesh it can be necessary to either scale the mesh up or down or to move the camera closer to or further away from the mesh in order to view it. The playground examples will give some idea of the values to use.

Extreme changes in the camera distance may require setting these values

```javascript
camera.minZ = 0.01;
camera.maxZ = 1000;
```

## Into the Playground

This list of files is in the [scenes folder](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/Playground/scenes) of the Playground and are availble for use. 

In the playground for the methods used to import meshes, the 'rootUrl' parameter has the form '"scenes\"' or '"scenes\folder\"' and the 'filename' parameter is as given below. The playground will show the actual terms required.
