# Available Meshes for Importing

## Into the Playground

This list of files is in the [scenes folder](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/Playground/scenes) of the Playground and are availble for use. 

In the playground for the methods used to import meshes, the 'rootUrl' parameter has the form '"scenes\"' or '"scenes\folder\"' and the 'filename' parameter is as given below. The playground will show the actual terms required.

Depending on the scale of the mesh it can be necessary to either scale the mesh up or down or to move the camera closer or further away to the mesh.
