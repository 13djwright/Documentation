# Available Meshes for Importing

Depending on the scale of the mesh it can be necessary to either scale the mesh up or down or to move the camera closer to or further away from the mesh in order to view it. The playground examples will give some idea of the values to use.

Extreme changes in the camera distance may require setting these values

```javascript
camera.minZ = 0.01;
camera.maxZ = 1000;
```
