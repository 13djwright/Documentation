# Using External Assets in the Playground

Sometimes you might want to load you own assets into the playground. Should the reason for doing so be to get help with a feature please think carefully before doing so. It is very likely that the issue you are struggling with can be isolated and presented in a simplified and more focused form using basic meshes and existing [textures](/resources/playground_textures) and [models](/resources/meshes_to_load). Doing this will lead to quicker answers as your question will be more understandable, since few people want to work through long sections of code.  Using the existing assets will also ensure that they remain reachable and the playgrounds you create will still be a useful resource in the future.  However should you still wish to use your own assets then this page describes ways of doing so.

## CORS Compliance

 Any site hosting you assets must be CORS compliant and use the secure **https** protocol. For example, IMGUR can be used for textures and for Javascript.
 
 For model files you were able to use **Github**  with a link generated by the  **[RawGit](https://rawgit.com/)** site to ensure correct MIME type. Unfortunately this site has now closed. Any existing links to files using **RawGit** can be updated using **[Raw Git to jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/rawgit)**.  Changes should be made to **RawGit** links before October 2019.

 To use **[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com)** with a file, named say _myFile.babylon_ on  **github** go to that file in your repository and click on the commit number. The in the address bar copy the part after `https://github.com/`, for example

 ```javascript
myGithubUserName/myRepository/commit/2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6
 ```
 replace '/commit/' with '@'

 ```javascript
myGithubUserName/myRepository@2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6
 ```
Add at the front _https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/_

 ```javascript
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myGithubUserName/myRepository@2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6
 ```
This becomes the URL address to the folder containing your file for use in `BABYLON.SceneLoader` for example.

Here is how the example path to _myFile.babylon_ would look like:
 ```javascript
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myGithubUserName/myRepository@2bd79648e08709145cd9575e6679b2ea360f12f6/myFile.babylon
 ```


## Examples of External Assets

Using the links to textures and models is straightforward 
* [Playground Example External Texture](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#TH16ID#1)
* [Playground Example External Model](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#TH16ID#2)

For Javascript files you need to wait for the file to be loaded before attempting to access it.
```javascript
var url = "LINK ADDRESS";
var s = document.createElement("script");
s.src = url;
document.head.appendChild(s);

var createScene = function() {

    //Scene set up code

    s.onload = function() {
        //any code calling on loaded file code
    }
	
    return scene;
}
```
