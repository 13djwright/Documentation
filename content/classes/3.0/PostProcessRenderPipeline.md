## Description

class [PostProcessRenderPipeline](/classes/3.0/PostProcessRenderPipeline)

Post Process Renders pipelines allow you to create a chain of post processes and attach it to a camera.

A render pipeline can be managed by enabling and disabling some effects and displaying a specific pass for debugging.
